# Employee Tracker Database

## Description

I was motivated to learn how to build a database using mysql so that I can use this in the future for free for employee management. It will help anyone build an employee tracker database that's easy to use and secure.

## Installation

Grab this code, load it into VScode, open integrated terminal on index.js file, then npm i, node index.js, and then proceed with database questions and answers to build tables. 

## Usage

Here's a video recording: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JkK_B5XEibhdvX_y-RPspN9Tqsscv8XY/view -- (needs some finessing :)

## Credits

Shout out to myself, and Phil for providing some starter code suggestions from class.
